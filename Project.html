   we did project on concept
   <h1>IOT based indistrial battery management system</h1>
   <h2>we use Aurdino uno microcontroller for interface</h2>
   <h3>voltage sensors are used to measure the voltage</h3>
   <h4>current sensors are used to measure the current</h4>
   <h5>gsm module is used to get the message of condition of battery<h5>
   <h6>buzzer is used to alert in case of emergency</h6>

   <p><b>Summary:</b> We use to maintain the condition of the battery in online in case absent of monitor we has to get the condition info of the battery<pre>message which we get is of whether the temp is increase or decrease and the condition is good or bad</pre><br> The components used for the project are <br>Aurdino uno<br> Batteries<br> Voltage sensor<br> current sensor<br>gsm mdule<br>buzzer </p>
